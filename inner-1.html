			<h1>Sand Point Gallery</h1>
			<h2>SAND POINT GALLERY MISSION</h2>
			<p>Sand Point Gallery is an exhibition space for activities that contribute to the vitality of the School of Art by providing a venue for exhibitions, installations, performances, forums, lectures, and media presentations that are curated, organized, and presented by the faculty, graduate students or undergraduate students of the School of Art.</p>
			<h2>EXHIBITION PROPOSALS</h2>
			<h3>Time Frame</h3>
			<p>Standard time frame for exhibitions is approximately 3 weeks, although other periods of time may be assigned due to high demand or will be considered upon request. Single night or weekend uses for performances, events, etc., will also be considered.</p>
			<h3>Terms of Use</h3>
			<p>Approval notice will be sent via email. Please read approval notice carefully for further information on the terms of use. SoA Sand Point doors are locked at all times and have combination lockboxes installed on them. Approved users will receive the current combination to doors that are necessary for access in the approval notice. Keys are not to be removed from the lockboxes. Entrance to the gallery will be from the east end of the building. Audience members are not allowed to walk freely around the studio building. Please refer to house rules on studio safety and security. All studios are meant to be quiet spaces. Use of sound equipment is only allowed on low volume or with the use of headphones. Artwork is not insured by the School of Art or the university. While the gallery is locked when not being attended and the outside doors are kept locked, each artist exhibiting must be aware that their work is not insured for loss or damage.</p>
			<h3>Maintenance</h3>
			<p>Users are responsible for maintaining the space and restoring it (walls, floor, lights, and furniture) to its original condition before moving out. Programs will be charged damage and clean up fees if necessary. A faculty signature is required on the application form to guarantee financial responsibility for any damage charges occurred as a result of negligent use. Please allow extra time for clean-up and moving out before your assigned time period ends. Condition of the room will be checked upon your departure and you will be held responsible for damages or cleaning fees if not returned to the proper condition. If you are planning to serve alcohol at the opening, you will need a permit application from Risa Morgan Lewellyn in the Art Administration office.</p>
